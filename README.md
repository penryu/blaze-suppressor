# Blaze Suppressor

**This add-on injects JavaScript into web pages. The `addons.mozilla.org` domain
disallows this operation, so this add-on will not work properly when it's run on
pages in the `addons.mozilla.org` domain.**

## What it does

Replaces text about flamingly quick things with absurd synonyms. This runs as a
content script and scans web pages, looking for text that can be replaced.

## Acknowledgments

The icon was created using [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/).

All emojis designed by [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) â€“ the open-source emoji
